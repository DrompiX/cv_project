## AdaIN approach
This code serves as an implementation of [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06868).

To run it, simply import notebook in [google colab](http://colab.research.google.com) and execute consecutive cells as in typical Jupyter Notebook. Consider ignoring first cell if you don't want to save model weights in google drive during the training, and change path for save dir to desired one in 
`train_model` function

```
# replace with your path
save_dir = "/content/drive/My Drive/CV_project/model_versions" 
```
