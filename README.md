## Experimental comparison of several neural style transfer approaches
CV course project implementation.

We have implemented 3 different neural style transfer approaches and compared them on part of `Fruits-360` dataset (we used apple, banana, cocos, lemon and orange). 

To launch each of the selected approaches, please consider to check each separate folder (except classifier, becuase it was trained as a standalone piece and then included in the code of all approaches).
