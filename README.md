## Experimental comparison of several neural style transfer approaches
CV course project implementation.

We have implemented 3 different neural style transfer approaches and compared them with part of [Fruits-360](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/rp73yg93n8/1) dataset (we used apple, banana, cocos, lemon and orange). 

To launch each of the selected approaches, please consider checking each separate folder (except classifier, becuase it was trained as a standalone piece and then included in the code of all approaches).
