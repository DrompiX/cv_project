# High-Resolution Network for Photorealistic Style Transfer

This directory contains implementation of an approach to Style Transfer proposed in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.11617).

We suggest to run .ipynb file in google colab, but if there is need to run it locally, ignore cells with gdrive entities.

There should be style and content images provided in the same path as .ipynb file. However, you can setup your own images with their paths.
