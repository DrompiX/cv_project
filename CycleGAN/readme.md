Both training and testing code is in cyclegantest.py. You can run them from there.
You have to create a folder named "fruits" with following subdirectories:

	Banana 
	Lemon 
	Orange 
	Apple 
	Cocos 

Class mapping file "id2class.pkl" as well as classifier weights named "fruit_classifier.pth" 
should be in the same folder as the running script
